    <div class="content">
        <div><h3 class="center">The first week in Codeclan is over! And it was much more intense than I expected. Even if we went during the precourse over the basic topics of Ruby, such as variables, array and hashes, working with them in class has made it a completely different experience.
        </h3></div>
        <div><p>Appart from the classes, which are interactive and open to questions, we started to work on pair programming during our labs, a really rewarding experience. Pair programming consists in two people working together to develop a product, one typing the code and explaining what they do (driver) and another one watching out for mistakes and contributing with suggestions (navigator). At the beginning I was thinking it was going to be slower than coding on your own laptop but it was just the opposite. When you are navigating you spot all the mistakes more easily and learn from that at the same time you try to understand the code from somebody else. On the other hand when you are driving you have to explain your code and learn from the ideas and suggestions from your navigator.
        </p>
        <p>The other core point of this week was TDD (Test Driven Development). The philosophy of the TDD is to write the tests before developing a product. Making the tests beforehand makes you able to think about what you want to design and is specially useful to break your idea in little pieces. If you do that you will have a function for every task, which means your code will be easier to maintain in the future and that you can use your functions in the future with other purposes.
        </p>
        <p>So far it has been a nice week and I already feel that I have learnt a lot even if we were just “recapping” the course contents. I can’t wait to start to dive into the unknown, digging deeper into programming. Next week, Object Orientation!

    <button class="collapsible"><div class="heading center"><h1>CodeClan Week 02 - Object Oriented Programming, planning and diagrams</h1></div></button>
    <div class="content">
        <div><h3 class="center">The second week of the course is over! It has been a really intense week and I had to face some challenges along the week. The content this week has been mainly focused on making us feel comfortable with classes in Ruby.
        </h3></div>
        <div><p>Using classes allows us to create our own methods and I feel during this week I have made a huge progress understanding what is going on under the hood of the Ruby language. Now I can fully understand what we do when we call methods such as ‘count’ or ‘each’, we are just calling a method from the class Array. Assimilating all these concepts was pretty straightforward since all of them were pretty logical to me. Apart from this we have been covering enumerators and as we have been using them I have been able to understand better how blocks work and why they are a really powerful feature in Ruby. We learnt as well the basics of inheritance in Ruby, which was easy to understand since it works in a similar way to CSS or HTML. Inheritance is an area which is really appealing to me and I am looking forward to learn a bit more when we get to Java.
        </p>
        <p>But not everything has been quick and smooth. Even if I can say I have assimilated well all the concepts of this week, I have found planning very challenging. We were introduced to diagrams on Tuesday and on Wednesday we spent most of the day on a lab putting in practice our planning skills. That’s where being over enthusiastic about writing code became a disadvantage. Trying to code as soon as possible I underestimated the time that was needed to plan the whole exercise, and in the end that slowed me down since I had to code and plan at the same time because I wasn’t able to prevent some of the problems I was going to find. I also learnt the hard way to take breaks and let my brain rest for a bit, which is as important as planning. Until this week I never really needed brain breaks but I can feel that planning and resting properly is going to become more and more important along the course.
        </p>
        <p>This last idea was reinforced by a software developer working at Airts, who came to CodeClan to give us some tips and show us one of the projects they were working in. One of these tips was precisely to try to be healthy mentally and physically. He spoke about how specially new software developers try to work relentlessly on a problem without having a proper rest, and that generates a burnout that explodes at some point.
        </p>
        <p>When I started to do the weekend homework I already could feel that my planning skills had improved considerably during the week. Even if I had to face some challenges doing the exercises I managed to finish all the extensions (including the advanced ones) being able to create a few extra features that deepened my knowledge about interactions between objects.

        Next week, databases!

    <button class="collapsible"><div class="heading center"><h1>CodeClan Week 03 - Databases, Psql
    </h1></div></button>
    <div class="content">
        <div><h3 class="center">My third week at CodeClan has flown away. It has been a really interesting week where we learnt about another key piece from the programming jigsaw, databases.
        </h3></div>
        <div><p>Psql was the first of the contents of the course where I was completely new and I really enjoyed the challenge. It was a huge amount of new information but it was as well one of the things I was missing when I was trying to teach myself with the information I was able to find on the Internet. I was missing how to connect useful elements as databases with your programming language.
        </p>

        <p>After we learnt the very basics of SQL (how to create tables, select columns, filter values, order them and link them) we started with the real challenge, establishing communication between our database and our classes or models that we run in Ruby. For this we used a Ruby gem, PG, that was able to translate our queries from our models to our databases and retrieve the information we were looking for. </p>

        <p>This was amazing and at the same time a bit confusing at the beginning, especially because your brain tends to not separate very well the database from the models. That’s where diagrams became even more important to simplify the interaction between our database and our classes breaking all the process into small pieces. Once you are capable to separate your work on the database from your work on the models everything is easier. You still have to write the queries on your classes but with a look at your diagram you can clarify your thoughts every time you get confused and continue working.</p>

        <p>On Thursday we were introduced to many to many relationships on databases. Until then we were working with relatively simple schemes, doing one to many (such as one jedi can have multiple lightsabers but not the other way around). To build many to many relationships, such as a film can have many customers and a customer many films, we need hinge elements that are able to keep track of our other tables. In these examples tickets would be the perfect hinge, storing the film_id and customer_id info. Thanks to this element we can use the powerful SQL joints, that can merge tables retrieving information from several tables.</p>

        <p>We were able to play with this on Friday and during the weekend with a cinema exercise. The most interesting part was on the advanced extensions, where we had to work with a new model and table (screenings). Having to redesign everything to meet these new needs and adding more complexity to the cinema was challenging, but it was completely worth it when everything was working properly.</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><div class="heading center"><h1>CodeClan Weeks 04 and 05 - Sinatra and building my first webapp
    </h1></div></button>
    <div class="content">
        <div><h3 class="center">What a couple of weeks! There have been two weeks full of work but really rewarding since I managed to build my first fully functional webapp.
        </h3></div>
        <div><p> All the fourth week was dedicated to learn about the MVC (Model View Controller) and how to link effectively everything we have been learning about databases and Ruby with html, giving us the last piece of the jigsaw and the chance to create interactive and living apps. It was really intense but it was probably one of the best moments since I started the course.
        </p>

        <p>And all of a sudden, on Thursday, the week was gone and we were given a few suggested projects from which we had to pick one and put in practise all we learnt during the last week and since the beginning of the course. I was excited and afraid at the same time, my mind was bursting with ideas and different possibilities.
        </p>

        <p>From all the options the one that I felt more attracted to was the spending tracker, since it is something I use for my daily life.  It was something I am familiar with and at the same time something that in a real life situation could be useful for a lot of people.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first day was very challenging but in the long run it sped all the project, making me able to sort all the difficulties. First I started designing all the UX part, which we were putting into practise for the first time. After several sketches I came up with an idea for the webapp and how it would look. After I passed it to Illustrator I started to design all my diagrams, for databases, models and even a list with all the views for my controllers. That solid basis allowed me to start working on my project in a really good position. In only two days of coding (friday and sunday, since I took saturday off), I was able to have my webapp structure working and meeting the MVP requirements. I was exultant.
        </p>

        <p>
          On Monday I worked on the idea of making the user able to delete tags from a transaction without deleting all the transactions vinculated to that tag. At the beginning it looked like something I could do without many problems, but after spending half of a day in it building new tables the models, everything started to get more and more complicated at the controllers, having to create two objects at the same time. Finally, after a recommendation from one of the teachers, I had to drop the idea for the moment, delete all my commits and come back to the MVP. It was frustrating, but I learnt a really valuable lesson, it is important to retreat when after a few hours you are not making progress and the code is not looking clean, tidy and efficient.
        </p>

        <p>
          After that point I focused on the rest on the advanced extensions finding them quite easy after all the problems I found the previous day. In a relatively short time I was able to do all the extensions and do a bit more in some of the parts like the budget, giving the user the option to create their own budgets and making them able to see all the transactions included on the budget and a balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          After that it was time to style, try to break the app and find bugs and errors (for which I asked my classmates for help). Even if I know that with more time I could add more features (I even had time to think  solution to the tag issue!), I am really proud of what I have built in one week.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next week, JavaScript!
        </p>

  <div class="entry">
    <button class="collapsible"><div class="heading center"><h1>CodeClan Week 06 - JavaScript!
    </h1></div></button>
    <div class="content">
        <div><h3 class="center">Finally the time has come, JavaScript is here, and it’s here to stay for a while. Welcome to the Wild West!
        </h3></div>
        <div>
          <p>JavaScript was the language I was more attracted to before starting the course. I was really keen to start with this module on Monday, innocent and unaware about what was about to come, the hardest and most challenging week since the beginning of the course.</p>

          <p>All we covered in Ruby in about two weeks was covered in two days for JavaScript. Even if a good chunk of the basics are similar for all programming languages we had to adapt really quick to a new syntax and a different way to do things. It was really interesting getting to know a language that is object oriented but quite particular since it doesn’t have classes as other object oriented languages. </p>

          <p>I heard that before but I never managed to fully understand what was the meaning of that until this week. The equivalent to classes in JavaScript are constructors, but we only store attributes in them, since all the methods are declared outside our constructors. To do that we make use of the prototype inheritance.</p>

          <p>We have been using prototype inheritance during the week using the following structure: Class.prototype.methodName. Even if I was using prototype inheritance it took me a bit (and reading <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain">this</a>  ) to understand how the prototype chain works roughly, which is basically objects inside objects (and by objects I mean key-value pairs). Prototypes and the prototype chain are a bit confusing but at the same time key to understanding how JavaScript works.</p>

          <p>The other thing I really enjoyed during the week has been starting to understand the DOM (Document Object Model) and beginning to work with front-end stuff. It is really curious when you access elements from the document, navigating through objects inside objects. Event listeners are really cool as well and being able to manipulate different elements of your document and see the results of it on the browser is really rewarding.</p>
