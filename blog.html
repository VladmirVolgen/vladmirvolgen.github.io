    <div class="content">
        <div><h3 class="center">The first week in Codeclan is over! And it was much more intense than I expected. Even if we went during the precourse over the basic topics of Ruby, such as variables, array and hashes, working with them in class has made it a completely different experience.
        </h3></div>
        <div><p>Appart from the classes, which are interactive and open to questions, we started to work on pair programming during our labs, a really rewarding experience. Pair programming consists in two people working together to develop a product, one typing the code and explaining what they do (driver) and another one watching out for mistakes and contributing with suggestions (navigator). At the beginning I was thinking it was going to be slower than coding on your own laptop but it was just the opposite. When you are navigating you spot all the mistakes more easily and learn from that at the same time you try to understand the code from somebody else. On the other hand when you are driving you have to explain your code and learn from the ideas and suggestions from your navigator.
        </p>
        <p>The other core point of this week was TDD (Test Driven Development). The philosophy of the TDD is to write the tests before developing a product. Making the tests beforehand makes you able to think about what you want to design and is specially useful to break your idea in little pieces. If you do that you will have a function for every task, which means your code will be easier to maintain in the future and that you can use your functions in the future with other purposes.
        </p>
        <p>So far it has been a nice week and I already feel that I have learnt a lot even if we were just “recapping” the course contents. I can’t wait to start to dive into the unknown, digging deeper into programming. Next week, Object Orientation!

    <button class="collapsible"><div class="heading center"><h1>CodeClan Week 02 - Object Oriented Programming, planing and diagrams</h1></div></button>
    <div class="content">
        <div><h3 class="center">The second week of the course is over! It has been a really intense week and I had to face some challenges along the week. The content this week has been mainly focused on making us feel comfortable with classes in Ruby.
        </h3></div>
        <div><p>Using classes allows us to create our own methods and I feel during this week I have made a huge progress understanding what is going on under the hood of the Ruby language. Now I can fully understand what we do when we call methods such as ‘count’ or ‘each’, we are just calling a method from the class Array. Assimilating all these concepts was pretty straightforward since all of them were pretty logical to me. Apart from this we have been covering enumerators and as we have been using them I have been able to understand better how blocks work and why they are a really powerful feature in Ruby. We learnt as well the basics of inheritance in Ruby, which was easy to understand since it works in a similar way to CSS or HTML. Inheritance is an area which is really appealing to me and I am looking forward to learn a bit more when we get to Java.
        </p>
        <p>But not everything has been quick and smooth. Even if I can say I have assimilated well all the concepts of this week, I have found planification very challenging. We were introduced to diagrams on Tuesday and on Wednesday we spent most of the day on a lab putting in practice our planning skills. That’s where being over enthusiastic about writing code became a disadvantage. Trying to code as soon as possible I underestimated the time that was needed to plan the whole exercise, and in the end that slowed me down since I had to code and plan at the same time because I wasn’t able to prevent some of the problems I was going to find. I also learnt the hard way to take breaks and let my brain rest for a bit, which is as important as planning. Until this week I never really needed brain breaks but I can feel that planning and resting properly is going to become more and more important along the course.
        </p>
        <p>This last idea was reinforced by a software developer working at Airts, who came to CodeClan to give us some tips and show us one of the projects they were working in. One of these tips was precisely to try to be healthy mentally and physically. He spoke about how specially new software developers try to work relentlessly on a problem without having a proper rest, and that generates a burnout that explodes at some point.
        </p>
        <p>When I started to do the weekend homework I already could feel that my planning skills had improved considerably during the week. Even if I had to face some challenges doing the exercises I managed to finish all the extensions (including the advanced ones) being able to create a few extra features that deepened my knowledge about interactions between objects.

        Next week, databases!
